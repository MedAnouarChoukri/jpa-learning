# jpa-parent

This module defines the common dependencies necessary for the children modules :
* JPA 2.1
* Hibernate 5.2.17.Final

All the children modules need the same dependencies.
They do the same thing, but not the same way : they will be more and more performant using JPA's good practices & tricks.
